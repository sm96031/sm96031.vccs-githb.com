                       <h1> What is it? </h1>
                       <p> A Snake Game made using Python and PyGame.</p>

                        <h1> Purpose </h1>
                        <p> Learn how game loops work.</p>
                        <p> Practice handling user input.</p>

                  <h1> Why I chose this project:</h1>
                  <p> I enjoy games and wanted a fun way to learn how to build a game from scratch using PyGame.</p>
                  <p> This is my Snake Game project. I created it using Python and a tool called PyGame. In this game, you guide a snake on the screen. The goal is to eat food to make the snake longer while avoiding walls and hitting itself. I picked this project because it’s a fun game and a good way to learn how games work, how to check for collisions, and how to take input from players in Python. It also gave me practice with PyGame.</p>

                 <h1> What the Snake Game do? </h1>
                  <p> “Here’s the game window.”</p>
                  <P> “I control the snake with the arrow keys.”</P>
                  <p> “Each time the snake eats the green food, it grows and the score goes up.”</p>
                  <p> “If the snake hits the wall or itself, it shows a 'Game Over' screen and the final score.”</p>
                  <p> “Pressing ‘P’ starts a new game. Pressing ‘Q’ quits.”</p>

                 <h1> Code Walkthrough </h1>
              <p> The Frist is the  game_loop().</p>
              <p> The Main function that:</p>
               <p> Runs the game loop</p>
               <P> Tracks input and Update the nake movement</P>
                <p> Checks for collisions and Updates the screen</p> 
  </body>

  <body> 
                  <h1> Movement controls:</h1>
                  <p> “This part checks for arrow key presses and moves the snake accordingly.”</p>
                  <p> python
if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
    x1_change = -snake_block
    y1_change = 0
</p>
  </body>

  <body> 
                 <h1> Snake body:</h1>
                 <p> “The snake is stored in a list of coordinates. Every time it eats, the list gets longer.”</p>
                 <h1>Food collision:</h1>
                 <p> “Here, we check if the snake’s head touches the food. If so, a new food is generated and the snake grows.”</p>
    <p> python
if x1 == foodx and y1 == foody:
    foodx = ...
    Length_of_snake += 1
</p>
                        <P> The Your_score() function:</P>
                        <p> “This displays the score on the screen in the top-left corner. It updates every frame based on how many food items were eaten.”</p>
                        <P> The Game over screen:</P>   
                        <p> “When the snake dies, the screen changes to show a red ‘Game Over’ message and the final score.”</p>
